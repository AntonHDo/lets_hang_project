    - I would like the website to log me in upon successful completion of the sign-up form.
      - So that I can seamlessly access the site's functionality
  - When I enter invalid data on the sign-up form:
    - I would like the website to inform me of the validations I failed to pass, and repopulate the form with my valid entries (except my password).
    - So that I can try again without needing to refill forms I entered valid data into.

### Demo User

- As an unregistered and unauthorized user, I would like an easy to find and clear button on both the `/signup` and `/login` pages to allow me to visit the site as a guest without signing up or logging in.
  - When I'm on either the `/signup` or `/login` pages:
    - I want there to be two different demo user buttons, one as the main user to do all the tests, such as scheduling a meet up or adding a friend
      - another to demo the status upon accepting or declining the first demo user. We can call it demo1 for the main user and demo2 for the second.
        - I want to be able to test these functionalities without having to enter credentials.
    <!-- - I can click on a Demo User button to log me in and allow me access as a normal user.
      - So that I can test the site's features and functionality without needing to stop and enter credentials. -->

### Log Out

- As a logged in user, I want to log out via an easy to find log out button on the navigation bar.
  - While on any page of the site:
    - I can log out of my account and be redirected to a page displaying recent FauxTweets.
      - So that I can easily log out to keep my information secure.
