Sometimes, subsections may be needed for different operating systems or particularly complicated installations.

##Usage

This section explains the principles behind this README file. If this repository were for actual software, this Usage section would explain more about how to run the software, what kind of output or behavior to expect, and so on.

Basic operation
A suggested approach for using this example README file is as follows:

Copy the source file for this file to your repository and commit it to your version control system
Delete all the body text but keep the section headings
Write your README content
Commit the new text to your version control system
Update your README file as your software evolves
The first paragraph in the README file (under the title at the very top) should summarize your software in a concise fashion, preferably using no more than one or two sentences.



The space under the first paragraph and before the Table of Contents is a good location for optional badges, which are small visual tokens commonly used on GitHub repositories to communicate project status, dependencies, versions, DOIs, and other information. The particular badges and colors you use depend on your project and personal tastes.

The Introduction and Usage sections are described above.

In the Known issues and limitations section, summarize any notable issues and/or limitations of your software. The Getting help section should inform readers of how they can contact you, or at least, how they can report problems they may encounter. The Contributing section is optional; if your repository is for a project that accepts open-source contributions, then this section is where you can explain to readers how they can go about making contributions.

The License section should state any copyright asserted on the project materials as well as the terms of use of the software, files and other materials found in the project repository. Finally, the Authors and history section should inform readers who the authors are; it is also a place where you can acknowledge other contributions to the work and the use of other people's software or tools.

## Additional options
Some projects need to communicate additional information to users and can benefit from additional sections in the README file. It's difficult to give specific instructions â€“ a lot depends on your software, your intended audience, etc. Use your judgment and ask for feedback from users or colleagues to help figure out what else is worth explaining.
